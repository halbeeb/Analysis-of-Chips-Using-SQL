# Chips-SQL-Analysis

Main Task

You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.
The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

Life stage: Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school.

Customer Type: Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.
